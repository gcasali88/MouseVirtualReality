function [ vr ] = BehaviourSettings( vr )
%opens/sets variables which will be called
%as well as the Behaviour data where everything is stored as a log file

vr.pos=[];                      % we want to know where the animal is across all environments; LogBehaviouralData function will account for that...
vr.AssignedEnvironment =[];     %we want to be the environment the animal is at any given time.
vr.Behaviour.fidBehaviour = fopen('Behaviour.data','w');%creates the file where the behavioural data is stored (better than updating this into the vr structure)...
